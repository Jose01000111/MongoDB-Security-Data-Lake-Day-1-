# 🧠 MongoDB SOC Data Lake — 5-Phase Lab with Wazuh

## 🎯 Lab Overview

For this lab, I built a mini SOC data lake using **MongoDB Atlas** to simulate how security analysts collect, store, correlate, and visualize log data. The goal was to create a functional system capable of ingesting and enriching logs from multiple sources, including Windows Sysmon, firewall logs, AND threat intelligence feeds.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **MongoDB Atlas** — Cloud database platform used to host the SOC data lake and store log collections.
- **MongoDB Compass** — GUI tool for exploring, querying, and verifying database contents.
- **Python 3 + pymongo** — Scripting environment for automating log ingestion, enrichment, and queries.
- **MongoDB Charts** — Visualization tool to create dashboards and present SOC metrics and trends.

## ⚙️ Phase 1 — Environment Setup & Planning

**Goal:** Prepare my MongoDB Atlas environment, install Compass, Python, and plan the SOC data flow.

**What I Did:**  
I signed up for MongoDB Atlas and created a free-tier cluster, added my IP to the network whitelist, and created a database user with read/write access. I installed MongoDB Compass for GUI access and Python 3 with the pymongo package. I decided on my log sources, including Sysmon logs, firewall logs, and threat intelligence feeds. Finally, I sketched the architecture of the data lake showing the flow from raw logs to parsing, normalization, MongoDB collections, queries, and dashboards.

## 📥 Phase 2 — Collect & Prepare Sample Data

**Goal:** Gather sample logs and normalize them for MongoDB ingestion.

**What I Did:**  
I downloaded sample datasets including Sysmon logs, firewall logs in CSV or JSON format, and threat intelligence feeds. I standardized the key fields across all logs including IP addresses, timestamps, and action codes. I converted CSV and text files to JSON for MongoDB ingestion and organized all files into structured folders for each log source.

**Deliverables / Documentation:**  
- Folder structure screenshot showing all logs  
- Example JSON file of normalized data

## 🗄️ Phase 3 — Create Collections & Ingest Data

**Goal:** Create collections in MongoDB Atlas and load all sample logs.

**What I Did:**  
I connected to MongoDB Atlas using Compass and mongosh, then created a database called `soc_data`. I created the collections for Sysmon logs, firewall logs, and threat intelligence. I imported all JSON files into their respective collections and verified the imports by checking document counts and confirming field types for each collection.

**Deliverables / Documentation:**  
- Screenshot of Compass showing collections and document counts

## 🔍 Phase 4 — Explore, Correlate & Enrich Data

**Goal:** Query logs, identify patterns, correlate data, and enrich with threat intelligence context.

**What I Did:**  
I queried Sysmon logs to find failed logins, suspicious processes, and file modifications. I analyzed firewall logs to find blocked traffic, unusual ports, and repeated source IPs. I cross-referenced firewall IPs and Sysmon activity with threat intelligence using aggregation pipelines and tagged matching events with enrichment fields like malicious, suspicious, and benign. I used Compass filters to visually explore correlations and identify anomalies across all log sources.

**Deliverables / Documentation:**  
- Screenshot of enriched data in Compass  
- Screenshot of correlation query results  

---

## 📊 Phase 5 — Visualization, Automation & Reflection

**Goal:** Visualize insights, automate log ingestion, and reflect on SOC workflow.

**What I Did:**  
I created dashboards using MongoDB Charts and Python visualization libraries to highlight top blocked IPs and most frequent event types. I wrote a Python script to automatically ingest new logs into MongoDB collections and configured MongoDB Change Streams to detect and alert on new malicious entries. I reflected on the workflow, noting lessons learned and potential improvements for scaling this into a production-style SOC setup.

**Deliverables / Documentation:**  
- Screenshot of dashboards summarizing metrics  
- Screenshot of Python automation script processing logs  
- Screenshot of MongoDB Change Streams detecting new malicious events  
- Summary notes on lessons learned and improvements
